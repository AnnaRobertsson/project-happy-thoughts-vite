# Project Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, we were supposed to practice our React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

This week has been difficult for me because I've been dealing with a lot of sad thoughts instead of happy thoughts. This is due to things in my personal life and it has taken a bit of focus away from the project for me. I was quite "lost" in my code at one point, but my amazing team mates helped me move forward. I have used chatGPT for comments to try to understand better. I started out with Diegos "Twitter-code" and tried to adjust it. A couple of hours before deadline I was finishing up some things when I realised that it no longer worked to post new thoughts. It had worked shortly before. It took me a long time to figure out why, taking time from the last things I was supposed to do before hand-in. Therefore I missed the deadline with a couple of hours while I made it work again.
